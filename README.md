**HealBarsClassic-Cell is a fork of the abandoned HealBarsClassic that provides better Heal Prediction for Cell using LibHealComm.**

## Overview

This addon fixes the issue with Cell not properly displaying incoming HoTs and Prayer of Healing from you and other players in your raid by using better frame detection methods and LibHealComm instead of Blizzard's API. 

If you use Cell, but miss having HoTs and Prayers on your bars like I did, try this out.

To use:

Download the latest version under Releases (v1) - HealBarsClassic-Cell-v1.zip and extract to your AddOns folder.

- Please ensure Cell's built in healing prediction is disabled in Cell options and use this addon for healing predictions (Cell Options > Appearance > Heal Prediction)
- Does not (currently) support Spotlight frames in Cell
- You must be in a party or raid (if you happen to have raid frames not hidden when you are solo)
- Use /hbc to customize colors, settings, etc..
