# HealBarsClassic - Cell Raid Frames

<div align="center">

**HealBarsClassic-Cell is a fork of the abandoned HealBarsClassic that provides better Heal Prediction and added customizability for Cell using LibHealComm in Classic WoW.**

## Overview

This addon fixes the issue with Cell not properly displaying incoming HoTs and Prayer of Healing from you and other players in your raid by using better frame detection methods and LibHealComm instead of Blizzard's API. 

If you use Cell, but miss having HoTs and Prayers on your bars like I did, try this out. This is as is for now, but if you have any issues, find me online or in the Classic Priest Discord.


## To use:


- Download the latest version under Releases (v1) - HealBarsClassic-Cell-v1.zip and extract to your AddOns folder
- Must have Cell addon installed
- Ensure Cell's built in healing prediction is disabled in Cell options (Cell Options > Appearance > Heal Prediction)
- Use /hbc to customize colors, settings, etc (just like the original HBC addon)


## ** Please Read **

- Does not (currently) support 'Spotlight' frames in Cell
- You MUST be in a party or raid (if you happen to have raid frames not hidden when you are solo). Please ensure you are in a group to test before saying it doesn't work :)
- Have only tested this in WoW Classic Anniversary version (others may work, not sure don't play others)
