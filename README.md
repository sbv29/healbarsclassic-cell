## Overview

This addon fixes the issue with Cell not properly displaying HoTs and Prayer of Healing by using better frame detection methods and Libcomm integration.

To use:

- Please disable Cell's built in healing predictions in Cell options and use this addon for healing predictions.
- Does not (currently) support Spotlight frames in Cell
- You must be in a party or raid (if you happen to have raid frames not hidden when you are solo)
- Use /hbc to customize colors, settings, etc..
