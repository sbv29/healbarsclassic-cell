</div>

---

## Overview

This addon fixes the issue with Cell not properly displaying incoming HoTs and Prayer of Healing from you and other players by using better frame detection methods using LibHealComm instead of Blizzard's API.

To use:

Download the latest version under Releases (v1).

- Please ensure Cell's built in healing prediction is disabled in Cell options and use this addon for healing predictions (Cell Options > Appearance > Heal Prediction)
- Does not (currently) support Spotlight frames in Cell
- You must be in a party or raid (if you happen to have raid frames not hidden when you are solo)
- Use /hbc to customize colors, settings, etc..
